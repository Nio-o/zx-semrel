# zx-semrel
[zx](https://github.com/google/zx) -based release script as [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) alternative (PoC)

## Motivation
Sometimes bloody enterprise enforces you not to use any third-party solutions for sensitive operations (like release, deploy, so on).
Old good script **copy-paste** hurries to the rescue!

## Usage
```shell
zx release.mjs
```
